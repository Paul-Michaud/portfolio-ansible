 ${BOLD}About me${NC}

 I came back from Antarctica in February, I'm looking for a job as ${BOLD}${ORANGE}Devops/SRE${NC} around
 Rennes, France. I can start in march.                                 

 I am open-minded and very ${BOLD}${ORANGE}curious${NC}, I like to solve problems and ${BOLD}${ORANGE} help${NC} others.

 I like ${BOLD}${ORANGE}sport${NC} in general, I practiced soccer, table tennis and handball in clubs, 
 I used to ${BOLD}${ORANGE}ski${NC} regularly in Quebec.

 When I have free time I try to ${BOLD}${ORANGE}travel${NC}, alone or with my family, I like to ${BOLD}${ORANGE}learn${NC}
 new things, enjoy time with my friends and work in some personal${BOLD}${ORANGE}projects${NC}. I also like 
 to play some ${BOLD}${ORANGE}video games${NC} from time to time (Ok, Maybe a bit more than that...).

 Feel free to contact me for more informations !
