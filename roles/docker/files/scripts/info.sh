 To create this ${BOLD}${ORANGE}portfolio${NC} I used different technolgies : 

 I use ${BOLD}${ORANGE}GoTTY${NC} (https://github.com/yudai/gotty) to be able to execute commands on a 
 server from an html page. Servers where you type your commands are ${BOLD}${ORANGE}Docker${NC} containers
 (One for each sessions, with a limit of session). The web server is ${BOLD}${ORANGE}nginx${NC}.
